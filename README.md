# 🎲 D20 Dice Roller with Webcam Entropy (p5.js)

This project is a visual simulation of a 20-sided die (d20) that uses your webcam as a source of entropy to generate the rolled number. 

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) – JavaScript library for creative coding
- JavaScript (ES6)
- p5.sound (optional, for rolling sound effect)
- HTML5 Video (Webcam capture)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user clicks the screen to roll the die.
3. The rolled number is generated using entropy from the webcam image.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main entry point
- `sketch.js` – Project logic (3D dice, webcam entropy, HUD)
- `dice.mp3` – Optional sound effect

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome recommended).
3. Allow access to your webcam when prompted.
4. Click anywhere to roll the die!

Or just access https://adrianomoura.github.io/CamD20/

> ⚠️ No webcam data is recorded or transmitted. It's used locally to generate entropy for the roll.

## 💡 Motivation

This project began as a simple idea: roll a d20 in a visually engaging way.  
Through iteration, it evolved into a reflection on honest collaboration, technical clarity, and making the best decisions at each step — even when that means changing direction.
